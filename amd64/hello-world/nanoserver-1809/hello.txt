Hello from Kubedock!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, we took the following steps:
 1. The Podman client contacted the Kubedock daemon.
 2. The Kubedock daemon created a Kubernetes Pod.
 3. Kubelet pulled the "hello-world" image from the container registry.
 4. The container runtime created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 5. Kubedock streamed that output to the Podman client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an http server container with:
 $ podman run --name httpd -d -p 8080:8080 python python -m http.server 8080
